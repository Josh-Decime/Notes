Today I cleaned up some of the code in ward_runner.py. I initially thought to just go back to the previous commit & then reintegrate functionality back, but having AI compare the code & only implement a fix didnt work. It also increased the file quite a bit still so I just cut my losses & went back to the larger file. Then GPT & I looked for some cleanup that we could do within the file. After cleaning a bit we moved forward on making the reports more useful. When you run it with OSV API it now collects the severity of the vulnerabilities. The LLM you have connected also gives a summary. There is also now a monitoring & continuous scans section at the bottom that gives an example of how to use the json scan to continuously monitor your dependencies, by only showing new vulnerabilities. 
The ward_runner file is getting far too large for my liking. I have some serious codebase cleaning to do. Ward_runner needs to be separated into at least 2 different files, some of unveil_tools needs to be moved to utils because ward_runner shouldn't be calling it for anything. Also, ward can't run on larger projects with more dependencies. Atleast, not the API version which Iâ€™m testing first, before comparing it to the OSV installed version. There is still a lot to do!
