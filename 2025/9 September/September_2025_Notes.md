I’m shocked at GPT 5’s ability to refactor code. It only took 2 prompts for it to refactor my file that was 1191 lines of code, into 4 files that added up to 941 lines of code. I spent most of my time today verifying it works & trying to uncover the changes. I haven't yet noticed any issues or major changes in functionality at all. The only real change I see in functionality is that some of my extra terminal logs for testing are gone. I’ve been prompting GPT 5 to explain the difference in code, how it is smaller than the original file, but it really seems to struggle with that kind of task. It couldn't explain how the code shrank by 250+ lines, would be more after repeat imports per file because they increased the total lines in the refactor. It gave some examples of changed code but it only accounted for less than 50 lines of code shrinkage. 

Even though it seems to all be working as intended I worry that some edge case handling code might have been left behind in the refactor & I just haven’t stumbled upon it yet. Working with AI is certainly a double-edged sword. This is why it is so important to have a good file structure from the beginning. I had rushed ahead with this functionality without proper planning for file structure, going forward structure needs to be a higher priority. But it's good to know it can refactor so well, if needed.

Ward now has better terminal logs for what is happening when OSV runs, if you don't have lockfiles or manifests to scan then it defaults to the API to still complete a report.

Ward now scans larger projects, it splits up the API calls & then stores them. You can even adjust the settings in the .env file which is a nice addition. I want any variables that you might want to change to be in the .env so there's only 1 file to interact with to finetune the agent. With that I’ll say that ward API calls are good for now. I installed OSV to test out how ward utilizes it. Unfortunately it isn't getting the information it needs to run, so there is more development that will go into getting it working.

Today I cleaned up some of the code in ward_runner.py. I initially thought to just go back to the previous commit & then reintegrate functionality back, but having AI compare the code & only implement a fix didnt work. It also increased the file quite a bit still so I just cut my losses & went back to the larger file. Then GPT & I looked for some cleanup that we could do within the file. After cleaning a bit we moved forward on making the reports more useful. When you run it with OSV API it now collects the severity of the vulnerabilities. The LLM you have connected also gives a summary. There is also now a monitoring & continuous scans section at the bottom that gives an example of how to use the json scan to continuously monitor your dependencies, by only showing new vulnerabilities. 
The ward_runner file is getting far too large for my liking. I have some serious codebase cleaning to do. Ward_runner needs to be separated into at least 2 different files, some of unveil_tools needs to be moved to utils because ward_runner shouldn't be calling it for anything. Also, ward can't run on larger projects with more dependencies. Atleast, not the API version which I’m testing first, before comparing it to the OSV installed version. There is still a lot to do!
