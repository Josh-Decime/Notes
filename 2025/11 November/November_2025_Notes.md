Since I am finally feeling healthy again I mostly spent my day cleaning & running errands. It is so incredibly nice to not be extremely sick! As for coding, I just reverted back to the best version of seance.

I continued to debug the seance –deep & –wide functionality, to no avail. I am thinking I should revert again & move on to the next commands. I also updated my notes for October.
