Some progress was made, it is now generating answers again but still having the same issues as before, but now with a bit more terminal feedback & some duplicate functionality was removed.

I’m still not in a place where I have a lot of time &/or energy to devote to this unfortunately. It's going to take a lot more work than I’ve been able to contribute to this, for a while, to keep it going. So far I’m just going back & forth trying to get seance –deep & –wide to both provide answers as they are intended. At this point I have little faith AI is going to be able to solve it & I’m going to have to really dig into this & understand where the root of the issue is & how to fix it. I really need to find a day to make another bigger push forward.

I just looked for some low-hanging fruit to do anything on this. Other things in the day took precedent so thankfully there was something quick & easy to do. I’m running out of simple low-hanging fruit things to do…

Since I am finally feeling healthy again I mostly spent my day cleaning & running errands. It is so incredibly nice to not be extremely sick! As for coding, I just reverted back to the best version of seance.

I continued to debug the seance –deep & –wide functionality, to no avail. I am thinking I should revert again & move on to the next commands. I also updated my notes for October.
