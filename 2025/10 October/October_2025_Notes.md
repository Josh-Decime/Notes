After going back & testing –deep it is still giving sub par results. So the issue I am facing is something other than senace_runner. So I need to review changes since it was last working well & find the true cause of the issue.

I reverted back to the best working version of –deep. The changes that have been made are providing worse results & that has not improved, so at this point it is better to revert & just re-add the useful additions that have been made in the last several days. I have so much more to say about my thoughts on this & what it has taught me. In particular about the strengths, weaknesses, & limitations of coding with AI. Unfortunately I need to commit this ASAP or it won't be committed until tomorrow.
