HAPPY HALLOWEEN! 👻

With how little time I have to devote to this, it is becoming increasingly difficult to add any real meaningful progress to the project. I want to keep working on it every day, but I have been considering putting it on hold until I have more time again. Because I don’t have enough time & am just trying to make some progress to keep committing code every day I am allowing the progress to be sloppy. Prioritizing speed, to get code committed each day, over everything is also causing me to learn less. If I could slow down to review everything & seek to understand it all better I would learn far more. A good middleground might be to still keep looking at the project & thinking about it every day but instead of committing code I could prioritize my notes, so I can think things through & still progress even when code isn't written. 

# 10/5/2025
Since the last 2 days worth of attempts to add –verbose to the logs didn't work I reverted to before I tried. To clean up the non-working code.

# 10/4/2025
I kept trying but still wasn't able to get –verbose to print to the transcripts.

# 10/3/2025
I want the –verbose information to go into the transcripts so it is easier to compare how changes affect what data goes into the LLM. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it to work in the time I had available.

# 10/2/2025
After going back & testing –deep it is still giving sub par results. So the issue I am facing is something other than senace_runner. So I need to review changes since it was last working well & find the true cause of the issue.

# 10/1/2025
I reverted back to the best working version of –deep. The changes that have been made are providing worse results & that has not improved, so at this point it is better to revert & just re-add the useful additions that have been made in the last several days. I have so much more to say about my thoughts on this & what it has taught me. In particular about the strengths, weaknesses, & limitations of coding with AI. Unfortunately I need to commit this ASAP or it won't be committed until tomorrow.
